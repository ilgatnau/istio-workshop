Exercise 2

Objective: Create an Ingress Gateway

Hints: 
* Follow instructions here https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/gateways
* Creeate the ingress gateway on its own namespace: <team_name>_ingress_ns
* We are using Istio and not ASM, hence intio-autoinjection label still required

Bonus: Escale Ingress to 1 replica to save resources in the workshop
