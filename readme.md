Istio troubleshooting workshop

You'll be provided with a Cluster with minimal Istio control plane configuration and some basic steps and references. From there you'll need to complete the work, but be alert, there's some bogus code may not be easy to troubleshoot, but that is the whole idea of this workshop really!
